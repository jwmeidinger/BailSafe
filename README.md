# BailSafe

## Introduction
As our team was brainstorming ideas we could pursue for this project, Jacob Oâ€™Reilly mentioned his interest in mountain biking and some of the dangers associated with it. Often when solo ridding bike trails, there is the danger of being injured or knocked unconscious with no one around to assist. We envisioned a solution which would be able to detect when the rider is injured or needs help and alert predefined emergency contacts with their GPS coordinates. Utilizing concepts learned from our Networking and Parallel Computation course we were able to develop a solution using both an Android Phone and a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth communications between them. Bail Safe recognizes when a user is in danger by placing a sensor in the bike seat connected to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi connected to the phone gathers GPS coordinates and sends SMS messages in emergencies.  

We want to give peace of mind to trail riders by alerting their friends and family in emergencies.
